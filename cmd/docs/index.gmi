# Gemini and Nimigem demo server

A dynamic small net server for scripting gemini:// and nimigem:// protocols.

There's not much to see on this home/default page, so please go somewhere more specific, such as one of its scripts. Alternatively, change this page to reflect your own content.

## CGI scripts

This server has CGI support, so the available resources will depend on the script that are installed. These scripts are installed under /cgi-bin

## Example Go dynamic handlers

The server supports dynamic handlers in Go. Two examples:

=> /example Example handler - ask me a question
=> /info Server info

## Source

This demo server uses the net-gemini server framework.
